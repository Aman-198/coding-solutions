## Problem

### Logical Error or Wrong Answer (WA)

Listen

A logical error is an error in a program that occurs when the code compiles and runs without producing any error messages, but it does not produce the expected or desired output.

Instead, it performs a different computation or provides incorrect results due to a flaw in the algorithm or logic of the program.

Logical errors are the hardest to find in a program. One needs to have enough debugging practice to figure out logical errors.

They can be categorized into different types:

- Incorrect Conditions
- Incorrect Index
- Incorrect variable usage

  print("infinity")
else:
  print(a // b)
